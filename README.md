Finn McLaughlin C15536837 Cloud Computing Assignment


--Description of Assignment
For our assignment, we were tasked to build a container management system using a restful API that will manage containers, images, services and stacks by defining several routes for each task, as well as writing a python program to execute these commands and a docker swarm with one manager and two workers.

Although I didnt explicitly show in my video presentation, you can see both worker and manager nodes are present when I run the GET nodes command at 2:22

--To access my docker container management service:   -cd CloudAssignment/assignment/my_application
                                                      -nano app.py

--To access and run my python script to execute app.py (in another VM):   -cd CloudAssignment/assignment/my_application
                                                                          -nano/python run.py
                                                                          -Menu system allows for easy navigation
